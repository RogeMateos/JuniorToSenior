                <h1>The Most Important Frontend Skill</h1>

                <p>
                    The most critical ability that separates senior front-end developers from their junior
                    counterparts is <strong>architectural vision</strong> — the capacity to look at any user
                    interface and immediately understand its underlying technical blueprint.
                </p>

                        A junior developer sees a webpage as a collection of visual elements. This leads to
                        code that is hard to maintain, reuse, and scale.

                        A senior developer sees a hierarchical structure of reusable, maintainable components.
                        They instinctively know where boundaries should exist, how data should flow, and how
                        interactions will affect the entire system.

                        If learning React is like learning to drive a car, this course teaches you to be an
                        automotive engineer. It's not enough to know how the accelerator works; you need to
                        understand how all the systems work together.

                        This course is not a step-by-step guide. It is reference material designed for you to
                        understand the <strong>why</strong> behind architectural decisions. It teaches you to
                        think like a senior.
